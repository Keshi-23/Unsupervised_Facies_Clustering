# Unsupervised Clustering for Well Logs
This example notebook illustrates how to use K-Means clustering to divide up the subsurface using well log measurements.

Please note there are no notes yet within the notebook about the steps. This will be added at a later stage.

# Data Source
The data used for this notebook is a subset of the FORCE 2020 Lithology Competition dataset from Norway. 

The original dataset contains over 90 wells worth of well log measurements and classified lithologies.
